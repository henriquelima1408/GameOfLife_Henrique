This application has created using unity and c# and allows the user to control the number of columns, rows, generation time of new generations of cells and even if the overlap of the generations of cells will occur automatically or manually.

 Controls:
      Left mouse click to make a cell stay alive or dead
      Space bar to refresh the generation manually (only works if you disable the automatic update in the initial menu)
